I initialized this work by following the instructions at
https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup and running the curl|bash script.  That fetched
zmk from upstream and made this repo, which is pushed to code.librehq.

Those instructions advise people to compile via github actions, which is way too
slow for an edit-compile-test loop.  Instead, I am now following the dev
instructions at https://zmk.dev/docs/development/setup.  Those instructions
reference a docker image with the toolchain ready to go, but for the moment I am
going to try the native compilation method.

Toward that end, `dosh build` should work to produce
`../zmk/corne-*.uf2`.
